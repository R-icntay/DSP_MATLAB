 ### Analysis of [Speech in the Time and Frequency Domain](https://github.com/R-icntay/DSP_MATLAB/blob/gh-pages/Code/DSP_MATLAB.pdf) using MATLAB
 
 In this lab, we analysed a speech signal in the time and frequency domain. The objectives of this experiment were:

a. To create a two second recording of one of the 10 digits in Kiswahili.

b. To compute a spectrogram of the recorded speech signal.

c. To obtain a segment 32ms long from a region with speech and another segment of the same duration from a segment without speech, plot and analyze them in the time domain.

d. To compute the Discrete Fourier, Transform of both signals in (c) above.
